# Claude Code Autonomous Management Setup

This guide sets up Claude Code to autonomously manage the Like-I-Said-Memory-V2 repository without requiring manual intervention or token sharing.

## 🚀 Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Add Anthropic API Key to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/endlessblink/Like-I-Said-Memory-V2
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
5. Value: Your Anthropic API key (get one at https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Step 2: Install Claude GitHub App

1. Visit: https://github.com/apps/claude-code
2. Click **Install** 
3. Select your repository: `endlessblink/Like-I-Said-Memory-V2`
4. Grant the required permissions:
   - ✅ Contents (read/write)
   - ✅ Pull requests (read/write)  
   - ✅ Issues (read/write)
   - ✅ Repository projects (write)

### Step 3: Push the Workflow

The Claude Code workflow is already created in `.github/workflows/claude-code.yml`. Just commit and push it:

```bash
git add .github/workflows/claude-code.yml CLAUDE_AUTONOMOUS_SETUP.md
git commit -m "Add Claude Code autonomous management workflow"
git push origin-v2 main
