## Current Project Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Components
- **Basic Python MCP Server**: Protocol-compliant server implementation
- **Node.js Bridge Architecture**: Hybrid approach using Node.js for complex tools
- **DXT Package Structure**: Self-contained DXT format with proper manifest
- **Windows Compatibility**: Addressed stdio and packaging issues
- **Protocol Compliance**: Follows MCP 2024-11-05 specification exactly

### üîÑ Current Architecture (Hybrid Node-Python)
The project has evolved to use a hybrid architecture:
- **Python Launcher**: `launcher.py` - Handles MCP protocol communication
- **Node.js Bridge**: `enhanced-bridge.js` - Executes actual tool implementations
- **Shared Libraries**: All original Node.js libraries preserved
- **DXT Packaging**: Self-contained `.dxt` file for Claude Desktop

### üìÅ Key Files and Directories

#### Core Implementation
- `dist-dxt-hybrid/like-i-said-v2/` - Main DXT package directory
- `enhanced-bridge.js` - Node.js bridge for tool execution
- `launcher.py` - Python MCP protocol handler
- `manifest.json` - DXT manifest with proper schema compliance
- `server-markdown.js` - Original Node.js server (as reference)

#### Library Files (All Preserved)
- `lib/` directory contains all 47+ library files from original Node.js implementation
- Memory management, task storage, AI enhancement, automation tools
- Vector storage, analytics, content analysis, and security components

#### Testing and Validation
- Multiple DXT files for different approaches tested
- Protocol compliance verification scripts
- Windows-specific debugging and testing

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### MCP Protocol Compliance
- Implements MCP 2024-11-05 specification
- JSON-RPC 2.0 message format
- Proper stdio communication handling
- Resource and tool discovery endpoints

#### DXT Manifest Format
```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "name": "like-i-said-v2",
  "version": "2.4.2",
  "description": "Like-I-Said v2 - Advanced MCP Memory Management System",
  "main": "launcher.py",
  "mcp": {
    "runtime": "python",
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

#### Windows Compatibility Solutions
