# Claude Code Session Memory & Drop-off
**Project**: Like-I-Said v2 Python Port  
**Date**: July 14, 2025  
**Status**: In Progress - Systematic Tool Implementation Phase

## üéØ Project Context

### Primary Goal
Port Like-I-Said v2 MCP server from Node.js to Python to solve Windows compatibility issues while maintaining ALL 23 tools and complete functionality as a Claude Desktop Extension (DXT).

### Critical Requirements
- **MUST include all 23 tools** (never reduce this number)
- **MUST work as DXT** for Claude Desktop  
- **MUST be self-contained** Python implementation
- **MUST follow MCP 2024-11-05 protocol** specification

## üìä Current Project State

### ‚úÖ What We've Accomplished
1. **Node.js Analysis Complete** - Identified all 23 tools and their categories
2. **DXT Manifest Format Solved** - Correct schema: `server: "python"`, proper structure
3. **MCP Protocol Compliance** - Fixed missing methods (initialized, resources/list, prompts/list)
4. **Multiple Working DXT Builds** - Various approaches tested and documented
5. **Systematic Organization** - Clear plan with phases and critical rules established

### üîß Technical Architecture Discovered
- **Complete Tool Inventory**: 23 tools in 5 categories
  - Memory Tools (6): add_memory, get_memory, list_memories, delete_memory, search_memories, test_tool
  - Task Tools (6): create_task, update_task, list_tasks, get_task_context, delete_task, generate_dropoff
  - Enhancement Tools (5): enhance_memory_metadata, batch_enhance_memories, enhance_memory_ollama, batch_enhance_memories_ollama, batch_enhance_tasks_ollama
  - Intelligent Tools (4): smart_status_update, get_task_status_analytics, validate_task_workflow, get_automation_suggestions
  - Utility Tools (2): check_ollama_status, deduplicate_memories

### üö® Key Problems Identified
1. **Tool Reduction Pattern** - Keep accidentally reducing from 23 to 4-5 tools
2. **Incomplete Implementations** - Building stubs instead of full schemas
3. **DXT Manifest Confusion** - Multiple failed attempts with wrong formats
4. **Organization Issues** - Not following systematic approach

## üìÅ File Structure Status

### Working Directory: `/home/endlessblink/projects/like-i-said-mcp-server-v2/python-port`

### Key Files Created:
- **ORGANIZED_PLAN.md** - Systematic approach with phases
- **PYTHON_PORT_COMPLETE_DOCUMENTATION.md** - Comprehensive project docs
- **Multiple DXT builds** - Various attempts and solutions
- **like-i-said-python-v2-FINAL.dxt** - Latest working version (but only 4 tools)

### Node.js Source: 
- **../server-markdown.js** - Contains complete 23-tool implementation to extract from

## üéØ Like-I-Said Memory Requirements

### User Explicitly Stated:
1. **"NEVER reduce tool count below 23"** - Critical requirement
2. **"Use the Like-I-Said MCP server tools"** - Not just TodoWrite
3. **"Work in organized fashion"** - Systematic approach needed
4. **"Stop forgetting crucial things"** - Document everything properly
5. **"Use multiple agents"** - Parallel processing approach

### User Preferences:
- Systematic task breakdown and tracking
- Complete documentation of failures and solutions
- Memory-based learning (use Like-I-Said server for persistence)
- No shortcuts - implement complete schemas, not stubs
- Organized phases with clear checkpoints

## üöÄ Drop-off Prompt for New Session

```
I'm continuing work on the Like-I-Said v2 Python port project. Here's where we left off:

CRITICAL CONTEXT:
- Goal: Port Node.js MCP server to Python while maintaining ALL 23 tools
- Problem: Keep reducing tool count and implementing stubs instead of complete schemas
- Solution: Systematic phase-based approach with complete documentation

CURRENT STATUS:
- Working directory: /home/endlessblink/projects/like-i-said-mcp-server-v2/python-port
- Phase 1 needs completion: Extract ALL 23 tool schemas from ../server-markdown.js
- NEVER reduce below 23 tools - this is a critical user requirement
- Use Like-I-Said MCP server for memory/task tracking (not just TodoWrite)

FILES TO READ:
- ORGANIZED_PLAN.md - Current systematic approach
- ../server-markdown.js - Source of ALL 23 tool schemas to extract
- SESSION_MEMORY_DROPOFF.md - This document

IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. Read Node.js server and extract complete schemas for all 23 tools
2. Use Like-I-Said MCP to create memories documenting each tool category
3. Build Python implementation with complete tool list (not stubs)
4. Create final DXT with correct manifest format and all 23 tools

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER reduce tool count below 23
- ALWAYS implement complete schemas, not stubs
- ALWAYS use Like-I-Said MCP server for persistence
- ALWAYS follow systematic phases
- ALWAYS document what works vs fails

The user is frustrated with incomplete implementations and wants systematic, complete work with proper documentation.

## üîç Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify current location
pwd
# Should be: /home/endlessblink/projects/like-i-said-mcp-server-v2/python-port

# Check project structure
ls -la ../

# View current plan
cat ORGANIZED_PLAN.md

# Check Node.js source for tool extraction
grep -n "tools.*\[" ../server-markdown.js

# Verify git status
git status

# List current DXT files
ls *.dxt
```

## ‚ö° Immediate Priority Tasks

### Phase 1: Tool Schema Extraction (URGENT)
1. **Extract Memory Tools (6)** - Complete schemas from Node.js server
2. **Extract Task Tools (6)** - Complete schemas with all properties
3. **Extract Enhancement Tools (5)** - AI enhancement capabilities
4. **Extract Intelligent Tools (4)** - Advanced analytics features
5. **Extract Utility Tools (2)** - Support functionality

### Phase 2: Python Implementation
1. Build complete Python server with all 23 tools
2. Implement proper input validation for each tool
3. Test each tool category before moving to next

### Phase 3: Final DXT Creation
1. Use correct manifest format (server: "python")
2. Include all 23 tools with complete schemas
3. Test in Claude Desktop
4. Verify all tools appear and function

## üìù Key Lessons Learned

### DXT Manifest Format (WORKING):
```json
{
  "name": "like-i-said-python-v2",
  "version": "2.0.0", 
  "description": "Like-I-Said Memory v2 - Python MCP Server",
  "author": "endlessblink",
  "server": "python",
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["-u", "server.py"],
  "capabilities": {"tools": {}},
  "userConfig": []
}
```

### MCP Protocol Requirements:
- Handle "initialized" notification silently
- Implement "resources/list" returning empty array
- Implement "prompts/list" returning empty array
- Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 response format

### Critical Failure Patterns to Avoid:
1. Reducing tool count (always keep 23)
2. Building stubs instead of complete implementations
3. Wrong manifest format (use "python" not "stdio")
4. Missing MCP protocol methods (causes infinite polling)
