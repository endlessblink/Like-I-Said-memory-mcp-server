# React Dashboard Component Error - Need Help Debugging

## Context
I have a React + Vite dashboard application that displays memory cards. The dashboard keeps crashing with React Error #130 (undefined component). Despite multiple attempts to fix the issue, the error persists.

## Error Details
```
Warning: React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check your code at MemoryCard.tsx:99.

Uncaught Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```

## Environment
- React 18 with Vite
- TypeScript
- Windows WSL2 environment
- Development server running on localhost:5173
- API server running on localhost:3001

## Current MemoryCard.tsx Structure
```typescript
import { Memory, MemoryCategory } from "@/types"
import { formatDistanceToNow } from "@/utils/helpers"
import { Edit, Trash2, Eye, Clock, Users, FileText, Loader2 } from "lucide-react"

// Component has:
- Category colors object
- Content type icons object
- getContentIcon function
- MemoryCard component export
```

## What I've Tried
1. **Removed UI component library imports** - Replaced Badge and Button components with native HTML elements
2. **Added missing imports** - Ensured all lucide-react icons are imported
3. **Fixed undefined variables** - Added ContentIcon definition and getContentIcon function
4. **Replaced emoji icons** - Changed all emoji icons to proper lucide-react components
5. **Fixed WebSocket connection** - Updated WebSocket URL to connect to correct port

## The Problem
The error consistently points to line 99 of MemoryCard.tsx, which is just an empty line between closing div tags. This suggests the actual error might be:
- A component being rendered as undefined somewhere in the JSX
- An import/export mismatch
- A build/compilation issue with Vite

## Questions
1. Why would React report an error on an empty line (line 99)?
2. Could this be a Vite hot module replacement (HMR) issue requiring a full restart?
3. Is there a way to get more detailed debugging information about which specific component is undefined?
4. Could the @ alias imports be causing issues with module resolution?

## File Structure
```
src/
  components/
    MemoryCard.tsx
    ui/
      badge.tsx
      button.tsx
  types/
    index.ts
  utils/
    helpers.ts
  App.tsx
```

## Additional Notes
- The error occurs immediately on page load
- WebSocket connects successfully after the error
- The same error appears multiple times in the console
- Development server is running in WSL2, accessing from Windows browser

Any insights on debugging this persistent React component error would be greatly appreciated!
