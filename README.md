## 🎯 What Makes This Different

Unlike simple memory tools, Like-I-Said v2 provides **intelligent task management** that understands your workflow:

- **Smart Task Tracking** - Say "I finished the auth system" and Claude updates your tasks
- **Automatic Memory-Task Linking** - Every decision, code snippet, and conversation links to relevant tasks
- **Natural Language Updates** - No commands needed, just talk naturally about your progress
- **Cross-Session Continuity** - Pick up exactly where you left off, even days later
- **Project-Based Organization** - Keep multiple projects separate and organized

## 🚀 Installation

### Installation Methods

#### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)
Works for both Claude Desktop and Claude Code - one command does everything:
```bash
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install

# Or install to a specific directory:
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install --path /custom/path
```

This single command automatically:
- Installs the MCP server completely (no additional commands needed)
- Configures your Claude client (Desktop or Code)
- Sets up necessary directories
- No manual configuration or menu interaction required

#### Option 2: Claude Code Direct Registration
If you're using Claude Code and Option 1 didn't work:
```bash
claude mcp add like-i-said-memory-v2 -- npx -p @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2
```

This registers the MCP server directly with Claude Code's configuration system.

### Verify Installation

After installation:
1. Restart your Claude client
2. Ask Claude: "What MCP tools do you have available?"
3. You should see 27 tools including `add_memory`, `create_task`, etc.

Example usage:
```
"Create a task: Build authentication system"
"Remember: We're using JWT tokens with refresh rotation"
"What am I currently working on?"
```

## 🖥️ Manual IDE Configuration

If automatic configuration fails, you can manually configure your IDE:

### For Cursor

**Option 1: Quick Setup (No Local Files)**
```json
// ~/.cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "like-i-said-memory-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "-p", "@endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest", "like-i-said-v2"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Local Installation**
1. First run: `npx -p @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install`
2. The installer will automatically configure Cursor for you

3. Restart Cursor and verify all 27 tools are available

### For Windsurf

**Option 1: Quick Setup (No Local Files)**
```json
// ~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "like-i-said-memory-v2": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "-p", "@endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest", "like-i-said-v2"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option 2: Local Installation**
1. First run: `npx -p @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install`
2. The installer will automatically configure Windsurf for you

3. Restart Windsurf and verify all 27 tools are available

### For VS Code with Continue

Follow the Continue extension's MCP configuration guide to add the server.

## 📊 Running the Dashboard

The dashboard provides a visual interface for managing memories and tasks.

### Starting the Dashboard

**Quick Start (Recommended)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/endlessblink/Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server.git
cd Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server

# Windows
scripts\run-dashboard.bat

# Mac/Linux
./scripts/run-dashboard.sh
```

**Manual Start**
```bash
# If you already have the repo cloned
cd Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server
npm install
npm run start:dashboard
```

### Accessing the Dashboard

⚡ **IMPORTANT**: The dashboard URL is shown when you start the server!
1. Look for "DASHBOARD READY! Access it at:" in the console
2. Open the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:3001`)
3. **IGNORE port 5173** - that's only for development
2. The dashboard shows all memories and tasks with real-time updates
3. Features include:
   - 📊 Task progress visualization
   - 🔍 Search and filter memories
   - 🔗 View task-memory relationships
   - 📁 Manage projects
   - 📤 Export/import data
   - 📈 Analytics and insights

## 💪 Key Features

### Task Management That Understands You
- **Status tracking** - todo → in_progress → done → blocked
- **Smart updates** - "I'm done with X" automatically updates status
- **Subtask management** - Break down complex tasks
- **Progress analytics** - See what you've accomplished

### Memory With Purpose
- **Task-linked memories** - Every memory connects to relevant tasks
- **Project organization** - Separate contexts for different projects
- **Semantic search** - Find information using natural language
- **Automatic categorization** - Code, decisions, research, etc.

### Built for Real Work
- **Dynamic path configuration** - "Change my task folder to D:\Projects"
- **Environment variables** - Set MEMORY_DIR and TASK_DIR
- **Windows optimized** - Full Windows path support
- **Real-time dashboard** - Visual interface (see console for URL)

## 🛠️ Available Tools (27 Total)

### Core Task Tools
- `create_task` - Create tasks with automatic memory linking
- `update_task` - Update status, add subtasks, link memories
- `smart_status_update` - Natural language status changes ("I finished X")
- `list_tasks` - View tasks by status, project, or priority

## 📁 How It Works

Tasks and memories are stored as markdown files with rich metadata:

```
memories/
├── project-name/
│   ├── 2024-07-15-auth-decision-a7b3c9.md
│   └── 2024-07-15-jwt-implementation-d4e8f2.md
tasks/
├── project-name/
│   ├── TASK-00001-build-authentication.md
│   └── TASK-00002-add-user-dashboard.md
```

Each task tracks:
- Status, priority, and timestamps
- Linked memories and subtasks
- Project and category assignment
- Natural language descriptions

## 🎮 Advanced Usage

### Natural Language Task Management
```
"I'm blocked on the payment integration because we need API credentials"
"The frontend is done but needs code review"
"What should I work on next?"
"Show me my progress this week"
```

### Dynamic Path Configuration
```
"Change my memory storage to D:\AI\Memories"
"Set task directory to C:\Projects\MyApp\tasks"
"Where are my files currently stored?"
```

### Project Switching
```
"Switch to the mobile-app project"
"Show me all tasks for the API project"
"What's the status across all my projects?"
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Server not connecting"
```bash
# Update to latest version
npx -p @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install

# For Claude Code users (no local files)
claude mcp add like-i-said-memory-v2 -- npx -p @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2
```

### "Can't find memories after path change"
Your old memories stay in the original location. Either:
- Copy them to the new location
- Change back to the original path

### Debug Mode
Set environment variable before starting Claude:
```bash
set DEBUG_MCP=true  # Windows
export DEBUG_MCP=true  # Mac/Linux
```

### Common Issues

**Windows Path Issues:**
- Use forward slashes: `C:/Users/name/memories`
- Or escape backslashes: `C:\\Users\\name\\memories`

**Port Conflicts:**
- Dashboard API uses port 3001
- Development UI uses port 5173
- Change with PORT environment variable if needed
