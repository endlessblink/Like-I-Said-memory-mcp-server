# Like-I-Said Dashboard - FINAL WORKING VERSION

## Version 2.4.8 - All Fixes Included

This is the **FINAL WORKING** version that combines:
- ✅ The proven working base launcher
- ✅ Path memory functionality
- ✅ Environment variable support for all libraries
- ✅ Proper pkg executable handling

## What's Fixed

### 1. Path Memory
- Configuration is saved to `dashboard-config.json`
- Custom memory and task paths are remembered between sessions
- Uses `BASE_DIR` for pkg compatibility

### 2. Environment Variables
All 8 library files now respect `MEMORY_DIR` and `TASK_DIR`:
- `lib/system-safeguards.js`
- `lib/memory-storage-wrapper.js`
- `lib/task-storage.js`
- `lib/dropoff-generator.js`
- `lib/file-system-monitor.js`
- `lib/project-task-manager.js`
- `lib/task-format.js`
- `lib/vector-storage.js`

### 3. Logging
- Creates logs in `logs/` directory
- Timestamped log files for debugging
- Shows memory structure analysis

## How to Use

1. **First Run**:
   ```
   dashboard.exe
   ```
   - Shows configuration menu
   - Set your custom memory path
   - Set your custom task path
   - Settings are saved automatically

2. **Subsequent Runs**:
   - Remembers your settings
   - Press Enter to start with saved config
   - Or type "config" to change settings

3. **Testing**:
   - Run `test-dashboard.bat` to see any error messages
   - Check `logs/` directory for detailed logs

## Key Features

- **Port Detection**: Automatically finds available port (3001-3020)
- **Memory Analysis**: Shows how many memories/projects found
- **Error Handling**: Creates logs even if crashes occur
- **Path Resolution**: Handles relative and absolute paths

## Troubleshooting

If the dashboard doesn't load memories:
1. Check the log file in `logs/` directory
2. Verify your memory path exists and contains `.md` files
3. Ensure memories are in project subdirectories
4. Check that authentication is disabled (should be by default)

## Technical Details

- **Executable Size**: ~36 MB
- **Node Version**: Embedded Node.js 18
- **Environment Variables Set**:
  - `MEMORY_DIR`: Your configured memory path
  - `TASK_DIR`: Your configured task path
  - `PORT`: Auto-detected available port
  - `NODE_ENV`: production

## Files Included

- `dashboard.exe` - The main executable
- `dashboard-server-bridge.js` - Required server file
- `test-dashboard.bat` - Test runner with error display
- `README-FINAL-WORKING.md` - This file

## Success Confirmation

This version has been tested to:
- ✅ Create logs directory
- ✅ Save configuration
- ✅ Remember paths between sessions
- ✅ Pass environment variables to all libraries
- ✅ Load memories from custom directories
