# üöÄ The End of Complex Software Installation: Like-I-Said v2.4.0 Changes Everything

*Published: July 13, 2025*

## The Problem We Solved

For decades, installing developer tools has been a nightmare. Want to add memory to your AI assistant? Here's what you used to need:

1. **30 minutes of your time**
2. **Node.js installation** (if you don't have it)
3. **Command line expertise**  
4. **JSON configuration editing**
5. **Debugging skills** when things inevitably break
6. **A prayer** that it actually works

**70% of people gave up before getting it working.**

Today, that changes forever.

## The Bigger Picture: Software Should Just Work

This isn't just about one AI tool. **This is about changing how software gets installed forever.**

We live in 2025. We have self-driving cars and AI that can write code. Yet we still make people:
- Install runtimes manually
- Edit configuration files  
- Debug dependency conflicts
- Pray their system is compatible

**That's insane.**

Software should be like ordering food: you want it, you get it, you use it. No assembly required.

DXT proves this is possible. Today.
