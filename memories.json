Phase 2 (Next week): 1) Memory analytics with usage stats, 2) Export/Import functionality, 3) Batch operations for multiple memories, 4) Memory relationships to link related content. Publishing plan: 1) Test everything with test-everything.bat, 2) Publish to NPM with npm publish --access public, 3) Create 2-3 minute demo video, 4) Share on Reddit r/LocalLLaMA and r/ClaudeAI. Key project benefits: One-command setup, works on all platforms, visual dashboard, persistent AI memory across conversations, multi-client support.",

SOLUTION: 1) Complete code rewrite - Rewrote App.tsx from scratch removing 500+ lines of broken code, 2) Fixed syntax errors - Resolved missing brackets and malformed JavaScript, 3) Modern architecture - Implemented React-Force-Graph with WebGL, proper TypeScript, modular helpers, 4) Proper server startup - Use npm run dev:full to start both API (3001) and React (5173) servers, kill existing processes first with pkill -f vite, 5) Verification - npm run build should complete, access http://localhost:5173/. KEY LESSON: Complete rewrite was faster than incremental fixes when mixing old/new code. Final result: Modern dashboard with Cards/Table/Graph views, WebGL visualization, Monaco editor, LLM integration, full CRUD operations.",

PROBLEM: CanvasGradient.addColorStop Invalid color errors caused by improper color concatenation (node.color + 99).

KEY CHANGES: Removed gradient.addColorStop with invalid colors, added proper null/undefined checks, simplified canvas rendering for better performance.
