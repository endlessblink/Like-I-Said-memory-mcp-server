Working: MCP server (6 tools), CLI installer, dashboard backend. TODO: 1) Fix dashboard-MCP connection issue (dashboard can't connect to MCP server running via clients), 2) Add loading indicators to test script, 3) Implement dashboard UI improvements (categories, card layout, filters). Test stuck on CLI installation - needs timeout. Run 'npm run dev:full' for dashboard. Files cleaned from 150+ to 44 essential.
