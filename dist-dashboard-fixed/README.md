# Dashboard Comparison

## Two Versions Available:

### 1. dashboard-windows-fixed.exe (THIS FOLDER)
- ✅ All hardcoded path fixes applied
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Memory loading should work
- ❌ No security fixes

### 2. dashboard-windows.exe (dist-dashboard-executable/)
- ✅ All hardcoded path fixes applied
- ✅ All security vulnerability fixes
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Production ready

## Testing Instructions

1. Test the FIXED version first:
   ```
   dashboard-windows-fixed.exe
   ```

2. Then test the SECURE version:
   ```
   ../dist-dashboard-executable/dashboard-windows.exe
   ```

Both should work identically for normal usage, but the secure version adds protection against:
- Path injection attacks
- Command injection vulnerabilities
- Configuration tampering
- Race conditions

## Expected Results

Both versions should:
- ✅ Load your existing memories
- ✅ Skip busy ports automatically
- ✅ Save configuration between runs
- ✅ Create logs in the logs/ directory
