## For Claude Code + IDE Users

**If you're using Claude Code with an IDE** (Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code), copy & paste this:
```bash
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install
```

That's it! Restart your IDE and you're done.

## For Claude Desktop Users

**If you're using Claude Desktop application**, use the same NPX command:
```bash
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install
```

## Test It's Working:
In Claude, type:
```
"Hey Claude, save a memory: I just installed Like-I-Said v2!"
```

Then close Claude and reopen it:
```
"What memory did I just save?"
```

## Common Issues:

**"Command not found"**
Install Node.js first: https://nodejs.org

Update to latest:
```bash
npm install -g @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2 like-i-said-v2 install
```
