## üì¶ Installation

### Installation Methods

#### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)
Works for both Claude Desktop and Claude Code:
```bash
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install

# Or install to a specific directory:
npx @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2 install --path /custom/path
```

This command automatically:
- Installs the MCP server
- Configures your Claude client (Desktop or Code)
- Sets up necessary directories
- No manual configuration needed

#### Option 2: Claude Code Direct Registration
If you're using Claude Code and Option 1 didn't work:
```bash
claude mcp add like-i-said-memory-v2 -- npx -p @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@latest like-i-said-v2
```

This registers the MCP server directly with Claude Code's configuration system.

### Option 3: Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/endlessblink/Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server.git
cd Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the dashboard
npm run build

# Configure your MCP client (see below)
```

## üîß Configuration

### For Claude Desktop Users
1. Run the NPX installation command (Option 1 above)
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. The dashboard will be available automatically

### For Cursor/Windsurf/VS Code Users

#### Cursor Configuration
Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "like-i-said-memory-v2": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server/server-markdown.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windsurf Configuration
Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:
```json

  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "like-i-said-memory-v2": {
        "command": "node",
        "args": ["/path/to/Like-I-Said-memory-mcp-server/server-markdown.js"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Accessing the Dashboard

- `GET /api/memories` - List all memories
- `POST /api/memories` - Create new memory
- `GET /api/memories/:id` - Get specific memory
- `PUT /api/memories/:id` - Update memory
- `DELETE /api/memories/:id` - Delete memory
- `GET /api/tasks` - List all tasks
- `POST /api/tasks` - Create new task
- `GET /api/status` - Server status
