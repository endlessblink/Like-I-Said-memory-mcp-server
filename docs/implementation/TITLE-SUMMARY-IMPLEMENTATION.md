# Title and Summary Generation Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive title and summary generation system for your memory cards. Here's what was added:

### 1. **Smart Title/Summary Generator Module** (`lib/title-summary-generator.js`)
- Intelligent content analysis based on category (code, work, research, conversations, personal)
- Optimized for card display:
  - Titles: Max 60 characters
  - Summaries: Max 150 characters
- Category-specific extraction patterns:
  - **Code**: Extracts function/class names, technologies used
  - **Work**: Highlights meetings, projects, tasks
  - **Research**: Focuses on findings and conclusions
  - **Conversations**: Shows participants and topics
  - **Personal**: Captures thoughts and feelings

### 2. **New MCP Tools**

#### `enhance_memory_metadata`
- Generates optimized titles and summaries for individual memories
- Can force regeneration with `regenerate: true`
- Example usage:
  ```javascript
  await mcp.enhance_memory_metadata({ 
    memory_id: "123456", 
    regenerate: false 
  });
  ```

#### `batch_enhance_memories`
- Process multiple memories at once
- Filters by project/category
- Configurable limit (default: 50)
- Example usage:
  ```javascript
  await mcp.batch_enhance_memories({ 
    project: "my-project",
    category: "code",
    limit: 100,
    skip_existing: true 
  });
  ```

### 3. **Automatic Generation on Memory Creation**
- The `add_memory` tool now automatically generates titles and summaries
- No additional parameters needed - it happens transparently
- Respects existing titles/summaries if already present

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- Dashboard already has functions to extract and display titles/summaries from tags
- The system uses special tags:
  - `title:Your concise title here`
  - `summary:Brief description of the content`
- These tags are hidden from the visible tag display

## How to Use

### For New Memories
Just create memories normally - titles and summaries are generated automatically:
```javascript
await mcp.add_memory({
  content: "Your memory content here...",
  tags: ["work", "meeting"],
  project: "my-project"
});
```

### For Existing Memories
1. **Enhance a single memory**:
   ```javascript
   await mcp.enhance_memory_metadata({ memory_id: "abc123" });
   ```

2. **Batch enhance all memories without titles/summaries**:
   ```javascript
   await mcp.batch_enhance_memories({ limit: 100 });
   ```

3. **Enhance specific project memories**:
   ```javascript
   await mcp.batch_enhance_memories({ 
     project: "like-i-said-v2",
     skip_existing: true 
   });
   ```

## Dashboard Display

The dashboard will now show:
- **Clear, concise titles** instead of truncated content
- **Meaningful summaries** that give context at a glance
- **Better card layouts** with proper text hierarchy

### Example Before:
```
# Site Control MCP Server Multi-Client Installation Project

## Project Overview
Successfully installed and configured Site Control MCP server across multiple AI clients (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Windsurf, Cursor). The MCP server provides Content...
```

### Example After:
```
Title: Site Control MCP Multi-Client Setup
Summary: Installed Site Control MCP server across Claude Code, Desktop, Windsurf, and Cursor clients
```

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Create a new memory and check if title/summary are auto-generated
2. Run `batch_enhance_memories` on existing memories
3. Check the dashboard to see improved card displays
4. Try the `enhance_memory_metadata` tool on specific memories

## Benefits

✅ **Better Organization**: Scan through memories quickly
✅ **Improved UX**: Clear, readable cards on the dashboard  
✅ **Automatic**: Works transparently for new memories
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Enhances existing memories on-demand
✅ **Smart Analysis**: Category-aware title/summary generation
✅ **Batch Processing**: Update many memories at once

The system is now ready to use and will significantly improve how memories appear on your dashboard!
