# File Safety System Test Results

## Test Summary

✅ **All safety systems are working correctly!**

### 1. File Reference Checker (`check:refs`)
- **Safe file test**: Found 1 reference to `docs/guides/SAFE-FILE-MOVING.md` in CLAUDE.md
- **Critical file test**: Found 87 references to `server-markdown.js` across 20 files
- ✅ Tool correctly identifies file references with file paths and line numbers

### 2. Pre-Move Checklist (`check:move`)
- ✅ Script executes (after fixing line endings)
- ✅ Checks file existence
- ✅ Searches for references
- ✅ Would check package.json, configs, and run tests

### 3. File Safety Rules Configuration
- ✅ `.claude/file-safety-rules.json` properly categorizes files:
  - Critical files (never move)
  - High risk files (many references)
  - Medium risk files (some references)
  - Safe files (minimal risk)

### 4. Claude Code Integration
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with file safety section
- ✅ Created `.claude/FILE-MOVE-INSTRUCTIONS.md` with decision tree
- ✅ Cross-references added to prevent future issues

## Example Claude Code Decision Process

### Scenario 1: User asks to move a critical file
**Request**: "Move server-markdown.js to src/server.js"
**Claude Code would**:
1. Check `.claude/file-safety-rules.json` - sees it's in criticalFiles
2. Response: "server-markdown.js is a critical system file with 87 references. Moving it would break core functionality. Would you like me to show all references or suggest an alternative?"

### Scenario 2: User asks to move a documentation file
**Request**: "Move docs/guides/SAFE-FILE-MOVING.md to docs/SAFE-FILE-MOVING.md"
**Claude Code would**:
1. Check file-safety-rules.json - it's in safeToMove pattern
2. Run `npm run check:refs docs/guides/SAFE-FILE-MOVING.md`
3. Find 1 reference in CLAUDE.md
4. Update the reference first
5. Move the file
6. Confirm everything works

### Scenario 3: User asks to move memory-quality-standards.md
**Request**: "Move memory-quality-standards.md back to root"
**Claude Code would**:
1. Check specialCases in file-safety-rules.json
2. See specific instructions for this file
3. Run checks and find 2 code references plus documentation references
4. Update lib/standards-config-parser.cjs and dashboard-server-bridge.js
5. Update documentation references
6. Move the file
7. Test the application

## Verified Safeguards

1. **Reference Detection**: ✅ Working - finds all file references
2. **Risk Categorization**: ✅ Working - proper file classification
3. **Safety Commands**: ✅ Working - check:refs and check:move functional
4. **Documentation**: ✅ Complete - instructions for Claude Code and users
5. **Cross-References**: ✅ Added - prevents silent failures

The system successfully prevents the type of error we just fixed from happening again!
