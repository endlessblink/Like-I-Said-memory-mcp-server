# Changelog

All notable changes to Like-I-Said MCP Server v2 will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.6.7] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **NPX Working Directory** - Fixed file creation issues by setting correct working directory
  - MCP server now runs with working directory set to parent of MEMORY_DIR
  - Solves Windows permission issues when NPX runs from cache directory
  - File operations now work correctly without elevated permissions
  - No special directories or workarounds needed

## [2.6.6] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Directory Creation in NPX Mode** - Fixed directory creation failures preventing memory saves
  - Added try-catch around directory creation to handle NPX permission issues
  - Ensures directory exists before attempting to write memory files
  - Gracefully handles directory detection issues in NPX environments
  - Memory creation now works even if initial directory creation fails

## [2.6.5] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Removed Hardcoded Path Check** - Fixed restrictive memory directory validation breaking NPX installations
  - The system was checking if memory paths started with a relative 'memories' directory
  - This check always failed in NPX mode where paths are absolute (e.g., C:\Users\User\like-i-said-mcp\memories)
  - Removed the restrictive validation that prevented memory and task creation
  - Now works correctly with both relative and absolute paths

## [2.6.4] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Critical NPX Installer Bug** - Fixed installer configuring Claude Desktop with non-existent local paths
  - Installer now properly detects NPX mode and configures Claude to use `npx` command
  - This fixes the "empty folder" issue where server files weren't being found
  - No more manual configuration needed!

## [2.6.3] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Removed Debug Logging** - Removed console.error debug statements that could interfere with JSON-RPC protocol
  - Debug messages now only appear when DEBUG_MCP environment variable is set
  - This should fix issues where the server wouldn't connect after v2.6.2 update

## [2.6.2] - 2025-07-15

### Fixed
- **Windows Path Handling** - Fixed memory creation issue on Windows when using custom paths
  - Improved path normalization for Windows path comparisons
  - Added debug logging to help diagnose path-related issues
  - Fixed case-sensitive path comparison on Windows
- **Enhanced Error Logging** - Added detailed error messages for saveMemory failures

### Changed
- Path traversal security check now properly handles Windows paths with different cases
- Better error reporting when memory save operations fail

## [2.4.0] - 2024-07-13
