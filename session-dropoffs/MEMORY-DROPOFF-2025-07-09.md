# Claude Code Session Memory & Drop-off
**Date**: July 9, 2025  
**Project**: Like-I-Said MCP Server v2  
**Location**: `/home/endlessblink/projects/like-i-said-mcp-server-v2`

## Current Project Context

### Project Overview
Like-I-Said MCP Server v2 is an enhanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) memory server that provides persistent memory for AI assistants with a modern React dashboard. It allows AI assistants to remember conversations across sessions and provides comprehensive memory management capabilities.

### Recent Session Work
Successfully fixed a critical memory duplication issue where batch enhancement operations were creating duplicate files instead of updating existing ones. Reduced memory count from 427 to 255 files (40% reduction).

### Current State
- **MCP Server**: Fully functional with 19 tools (6 memory + 6 task + 7 advanced)
- **Dashboard**: React + TypeScript frontend with real-time WebSocket updates
- **Memory System**: Clean and deduplicated (255 memories across 14 projects)
- **Task Management**: Working with intelligent automation and NLP processing
- **Data Protection**: Comprehensive safeguards and integrity checks in place

### Key Files Modified
1. `server-markdown.js` - Fixed `saveMemory()` and `updateMemory()` methods
2. `lib/memory-deduplicator.js` - New utility for cleaning duplicates
3. Memory files cleaned up (172 duplicates removed)

## Like-I-Said Memory

### User Preferences & Requirements
1. **No Emojis**: Avoid using emojis in communication unless explicitly requested
2. **Direct Communication**: Be concise and to the point
3. **Testing Focus**: Always run tests before marking tasks complete
4. **Commit Messages**: Use detailed, structured commit messages with co-author attribution
5. **Code Style**: Follow existing patterns, no unnecessary comments unless asked

### Technical Decisions
1. **Memory Storage**: Use markdown files with YAML frontmatter
2. **Project Organization**: Memories organized by project context
3. **Duplication Prevention**: Check for existing IDs before creating new files
4. **Batch Operations**: Update existing files instead of creating new ones
5. **Cleanup Strategy**: Keep newest version when duplicates found

### Architecture Choices
- File-based storage for simplicity and portability
- WebSocket for real-time dashboard updates
- Separate API bridge server for web interface
- Task-memory auto-linking based on content similarity

## Drop-off Prompt for New Session

```markdown
I'm working on the Like-I-Said MCP Server v2 project located at `/home/endlessblink/projects/like-i-said-mcp-server-v2`. This is an MCP memory server with React dashboard.

I just fixed a memory duplication issue where batch operations were creating duplicate files. The fix modifies saveMemory() to check for existing memories by ID and update in place. I've reduced memories from 427 to 255 files.

Key context:
- The MCP server has 19 tools including memory, task, and automation tools
- Memory files use markdown with YAML frontmatter
- Dashboard runs on port 5173, API on 3001
- No emojis in responses, be direct and concise
- Run tests before marking tasks complete

Current branch is main with 10 commits ahead of origin. The memory deduplication fix is already committed.

## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check project location
pwd  # Should be: /home/endlessblink/projects/like-i-said-mcp-server-v2

# Verify memory cleanup
find memories/ -name "*.md" -type f | wc -l  # Should show ~255

# Check git status
git status  # Should be clean
git log --oneline -3  # Recent commits

# Test MCP server
npm run test:mcp

# Start development environment
npm run dev:full  # Starts both API (3001) and React (5173)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Test Memory System**: Verify batch enhancement works without creating duplicates
2. **Dashboard Testing**: Ensure memory display shows correct unique counts
3. **Performance Check**: Verify improved performance with fewer files
4. **Documentation**: Update README with deduplication tool usage

### Future Improvements
1. **Memory Search Optimization**: Implement better indexing for 255+ memories
2. **Project Consolidation**: Further organize scattered project memories
3. **Auto-Cleanup Schedule**: Set up periodic deduplication runs
4. **Memory Analytics**: Add dashboard view for memory health metrics

### Known Issues
- Some memories still have inconsistent metadata format
- Project name case inconsistencies (resolved but watch for new ones)
- 54 files from July 9th batch remain (intentionally kept as valid)

## Environment Status

### Dependencies
- Node.js project with npm
- Main deps: @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, React, TypeScript, Vite
- Dev deps: Playwright for testing, Storybook for components

### Configuration
- MCP server: `server-markdown.js`
- Dashboard API: `dashboard-server-bridge.js`
- Frontend: React app in `src/`
- Memory storage: `memories/` directory
- Task storage: `tasks/` directory

### Testing
```bash
npm test          # Run Jest tests
npm run test:mcp  # Test MCP server
npm run storybook # Component development
```

## Session Highlights

1. **Problem Solved**: Memory duplication from batch operations
2. **Technical Achievement**: Implemented smart update logic that preserves existing files
3. **Cleanup Success**: 40% reduction in file count while preserving all unique memories
4. **Tool Created**: Reusable deduplication utility for future maintenance
5. **Prevention**: Future batch operations won't create duplicates

This session focused on system maintenance and optimization, setting up the project for sustainable growth without the previous duplication issues.
