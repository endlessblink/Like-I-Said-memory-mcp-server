- Optional analytics and telemetry features
- Data collection practices
- Your rights and choices

---

## The Simple Version

**We don't collect your personal data or content. Period.**

Our optional analytics only track anonymous usage patterns to help us improve the software. Everything is anonymous, opt-in only, and you can disable it anytime.

---

## Data Collection Principles

### 1. üîí Privacy by Design
- **Anonymous by default** - No personal information collected
- **Opt-in only** - Analytics disabled by default
- **Transparent** - Clear about what we collect
- **Minimal** - Only essential metrics
- **Secure** - Encrypted transmission

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è Data Sovereignty
- **Your data stays yours** - Memories and tasks stored locally
- **No cloud requirement** - Works completely offline
- **You control everything** - Enable/disable features as needed

### 3. ‚úÖ User Control
- **Easy opt-out** - Disable anytime with one command
- **Clear status** - Always know what's enabled
- **No dark patterns** - Honest, straightforward choices

---

## What We Collect (When Analytics is Enabled)

### ‚úÖ Anonymous Usage Metrics
When you opt-in to analytics, we collect:

**Tool Usage Patterns**
- Which MCP tools you use (add_memory, create_task, etc.)
- How often you use different features
- Success/error rates for operations
- Performance metrics (response times)

**System Information**
- Operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Node.js version
- Installation type (DXT vs manual)
- Timezone (for usage pattern analysis)

**Usage Statistics**
- Session duration
- Number of tools used per session
- General activity levels
- Error frequencies

### ‚ùå What We Never Collect

**Personal Information**
- No names, emails, or contact information
- No IP addresses or location data
- No device identifiers or hardware info

**Your Content**
- Never your memories or their content
- Never your tasks or their details
- Never file paths or names
- Never search queries or terms

**System Details**
- No file system structure
- No installed software lists
- No network configuration
- No other applications data

---

## How Analytics Works

### Anonymous Identification
- **Installation ID**: Random UUID generated locally
- **Session ID**: Temporary identifier for each session
- **No tracking across devices** - Each installation is independent
- **No user profiling** - Cannot link data to individuals

### Data Transmission
- **Encrypted HTTPS** - All data sent securely
- **Minimal payloads** - Only essential metrics
- **Fail-safe operation** - Analytics never breaks core functionality
- **Timeout protection** - Won't slow down your tools

### Data Storage
- **Aggregated only** - Individual events combined into patterns
- **No personal identifiers** - Cannot trace back to users
- **Retention limits** - Old data automatically deleted
- **Secure infrastructure** - Industry-standard protection

```
Privacy Policy: configure_analytics privacy
```

**‚úÖ Local Data Control**
