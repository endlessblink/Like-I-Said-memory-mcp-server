## Context Summary
I need help with the Like-I-Said Memory v2.3.2 production version Docker testing environment. The main memory loading issue has been SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED, but there's one remaining issue with the relationships graph component.

## Current Status: ‚úÖ MAJOR SUCCESS
- **Docker Environment**: Working perfectly
- **Memory Loading**: ‚úÖ 110+ memories load correctly in Docker
- **Dashboard Access**: ‚úÖ Available at http://localhost:3002  
- **File Watching**: ‚úÖ Shows correct path: `üìÅ Watching: /app/memories`
- **CRUD Operations**: ‚úÖ Create, edit, delete memories works
- **Real-time Updates**: ‚úÖ WebSocket connections functional

## Outstanding Issue: Relationships Graph
The memories load and display correctly, but the **relationships graph component is not loading** in the Docker environment. This works fine in local development but fails in Docker.

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Current working Docker setup
cd D:\APPSNospaces\Like-I-said-mcp-server-v2
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build like-i-said-dashboard

# Access: http://localhost:3002
# Memories will load, but relationships graph won't render
```

## Project Details
- **Package**: @endlessblink/like-i-said-v2@2.3.2 (published production version)
- **Architecture**: Pure markdown storage, React dashboard, 6 core memory tools
- **Memories**: 110+ restored from backup (no GitHub integration)
- **Docker Strategy**: Copy approach - files copied from NPM global to /app/

## Files to Check for Graph Issue
- `src/components/MemoryRelationships.tsx` - Main relationships component
- `src/components/ModernGraph.tsx` - Graph rendering component  
- Browser console for React/JavaScript errors
- Check if graph libraries (D3, Cytoscape, etc.) load properly in Docker

## Key Files Created in Previous Session
- `docker-compose.yml` - Working configuration with copy strategy
- `DOCKER-TESTING-MEMORY.md` - Complete documentation
- `DROPOFF-COMMANDS.md` - Quick reference
- Multiple memory files documenting the complete troubleshooting journey

## What I Need Help With
Please investigate why the relationships graph component doesn't load in the Docker environment when the rest of the dashboard works perfectly. The graph likely depends on some library or file that isn't being copied correctly to the Docker container.

## Expected Outcome
The relationships graph should render properly showing connections between memories based on shared tags, projects, and temporal proximity, just like it does in local development.
