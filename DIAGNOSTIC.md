# MCP Connection Diagnostic

Looking at your logs, I see something interesting:

## What's Actually Happening

1. **Server IS working correctly**:
   - Responds to initialize: ✅
   - Returns all tools in tools/list: ✅
   - Handles "Method not found" for prompts/resources correctly: ✅

2. **The startup messages appear AFTER the response**:
   ```
   21:12:28.030Z - Using MCP server command
   21:12:30.628Z - Message from server (initialize response)
   [BETWEEN THESE] - "Like-I-Said Memory Server v2" messages appear
   ```

## The Real Problem

The tools are being sent correctly but Claude Desktop isn't showing them. This could be because:

1. **Tool count**: You have 22 tools, but only 7 are shown in the logs. Maybe Claude Desktop has a limit?

2. **Tool schema**: One of your tool schemas might be invalid, causing Claude to reject all tools.

3. **Server name conflict**: Maybe "like-i-said-memory-v2" conflicts with something.

## Tests to Try

### 1. Use the Minimal Server
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test-memory": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["D:/APPSNospaces/Like-I-said-mcp-server-v2/mcp-server-standalone.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

This has only 3 simple tools. If this works, the issue is with your tool definitions.

### 2. Check Claude Desktop Version
Make sure you have the latest version. Some older versions had MCP bugs.

### 3. Try a Known Working Server
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

If this doesn't work either, the issue is with your Claude Desktop installation, not your server.
