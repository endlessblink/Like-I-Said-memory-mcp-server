# Like-I-Said v3 Development Plan

## Current State (v2.3.7)
✅ **Backup Created**: `backups/like-i-said-v2-complete-backup-20250731-235844.tar.gz` (5.9MB)
✅ **All core files preserved**: Source, configs, docs, scripts
✅ **Working system**: 27 MCP tools, React dashboard, task-memory linking

## v3 Development Options

### Option 1: Clone to New Directory
```bash
# Create v3 as a separate project
cd /mnt/d/APPSNospaces
mkdir like-i-said-mcp-server-v3
cd like-i-said-mcp-server-v3
tar -xzf ../like-i-said-mcp-server-v2/backups/like-i-said-v2-complete-backup-20250731-235844.tar.gz
npm install
```

### Option 2: Branch-Based Development
```bash
# Work in the same directory with git branches
git checkout -b v3-development
# Make v3 changes
# Keep v2 on main branch
```

### Option 3: In-Place Upgrade
```bash
# Upgrade current directory to v3
# Backup already created for safety
# Start implementing v3 features
```

## Next Steps

1. **Choose Development Approach** (Option 1, 2, or 3)
2. **Set up v3 environment**
3. **Create v3 roadmap with priorities**
4. **Start with backward compatibility layer**
5. **Implement features incrementally**

## Backward Compatibility Plan

- Keep all v2 tool names and signatures
- Add new tools with v3 prefix
- Maintain markdown storage format
- Support v2 API endpoints
- Provide migration utilities

## Breaking Changes (if needed)

- New memory schema with enhanced metadata
- Improved task-memory relationship model
- Better project organization structure
- Enhanced security model

Ready to start v3 development! The v2 backup ensures we can always reference or restore the working system.
