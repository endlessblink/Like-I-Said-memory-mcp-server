---## Cursor-Memory-Bank Features to Implement

**HIERARCHICAL COMPLEXITY LEVELS (1-4):**
- Level 1: Simple memory operations (add, get, delete)
- Level 2: Enhanced operations with categorization and tagging
- Level 3: Project-based organization with cross-references
- Level 4: Advanced analytics, relationships, and automation

**ENHANCED FRONTMATTER STRUCTURE:**

**VISUAL PROCESS MAPS:**
- Mermaid diagram generation for complex memory relationships
- Flow charts for memory workflows
- Dependency graphs for project-related memories

**MODE-SPECIFIC WORKFLOWS:**
- Creative mode: Enhanced ideation and brainstorming features
- Analytical mode: Data-driven insights and relationships
- Archive mode: Long-term storage and retrieval optimization

**IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:**
1. Enhanced frontmatter structure (immediate)
2. Hierarchical complexity detection (next)
3. Visual process maps with Mermaid (week 2)
4. Mode-specific workflows (future)
