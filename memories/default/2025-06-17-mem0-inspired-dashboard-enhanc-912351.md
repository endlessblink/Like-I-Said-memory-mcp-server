---MEM0-INSPIRED DASHBOARD ENHANCEMENT PROGRESS (June 17, 2025): Research completed on mem0's MCP implementation and dashboard design. Enhanced memory schema implemented with metadata (created, modified, lastAccessed, accessCount, clients, contentType, size), project organization, and categories (personal/work/code/research/conversations/preferences). Major UI improvements: MemoryCard component with hover effects and category badges, AdvancedSearch with expandable filters and tag management, responsive grid layout (1-2-3 columns), full-text search across content/tags/projects, backward compatibility maintained. Development environment: Both API (3001) and React (5173) servers running, TypeScript compilation successful, ready for browser testing.
