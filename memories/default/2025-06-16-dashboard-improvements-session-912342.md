---DASHBOARD IMPROVEMENTS SESSION (June 16, 2025) - MAJOR UI/UX FIXES COMPLETED:

âœ… COMPLETED HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES:
1. **Removed redundant Graph view** - Eliminated duplicate graph functionality, now only in dedicated areas
2. **Fixed LLM JSON parsing errors** - Added proper escaping for quotes/newlines, fallback regex parsing
3. **Fixed enhanced memory display** - Hidden title:/summary: metadata tags from UI, only show meaningful tags
4. **Improved graph text readability** - Fixed font scaling (min 12px), added black stroke outline for contrast
5. **Changed nodes to rounded rectangles** - Adaptive shapes that always fit text content instead of circles
6. **Added click-to-edit in graph** - Distinguish drag vs click (5px threshold) to open edit dialog
7. **Added graph tooltips** - Hover shows full memory content preview
8. **Cleaned navigation** - Removed redundant Graph tab, simplified to Dashboard + Memories only

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS:
- Custom canvas rendering with zoom-aware text scaling
- Rounded rectangle nodes with automatic sizing based on text dimensions
- Enhanced LLM integration with proper JSON escaping and error handling
- Separated visible tags from metadata tags (title:/summary: hidden)
- Click vs drag detection for graph interactions
- Improved force simulation parameters for better node distribution

ðŸ“‹ REMAINING HIGH-PRIORITY TASKS:
1. **Advanced filtering** - Date ranges, content search, tag combinations for memories tab
2. **Contextual tag system** - Auto-generate meaningful tags from content analysis instead of generic ones
3. **Enhanced search** - Full-text search with highlighting, fuzzy matching
4. **Sorting options** - By date, relevance, size, connections
5. **Bulk operations** - Multi-select for batch delete/tag/export
6. **Memory type detection** - Auto-classify as code, documentation, ideas, notes

ðŸ’¡ KEY INSIGHTS:
- Graph visualization now uses rounded rectangles that scale properly with text
- LLM enhancements work without showing metadata as visible tags
- UI is cleaner without redundant graph functionality
- Text readability maintained across all zoom levels
- Better user interactions with proper click/drag handling

ðŸŽ¯ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES:
1. Implement advanced filtering system for memories
2. Improve tag generation with content analysis
3. Add comprehensive search capabilities
4. Consider memory categorization and auto-tagging features

All changes committed to git. Ready for next development session.
