---CURSOR-MEMORY-BANK ANALYSIS & INTEGRATION IDEAS: After analyzing the repository, identified key concepts to integrate: 1) Hierarchical complexity levels (1-4) for different memory operations, 2) Visual process maps using Mermaid diagrams for user guidance, 3) Progressive documentation scaling with task complexity, 4) Mode-specific workflows for different memory operations, 5) Creative phase enforcement for complex organization tasks, 6) Platform-aware operations, 7) Token optimization techniques, 8) Enhanced markdown frontmatter structure, 9) Archive and reflection capabilities for memory lifecycle management, 10) Advanced project-based organization with cross-references.
