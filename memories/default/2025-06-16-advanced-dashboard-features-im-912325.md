---Advanced Dashboard Features Implementation Plan: 1) Advanced Content Editor: Rich text editor with markdown support, syntax highlighting for code blocks, live preview, auto-save, version history, collaborative editing. 2) Structured Memory View: Hierarchical memory organization, metadata panels (created/modified dates, usage stats, relationships), visual memory map with connections, expandable/collapsible tree view, drag-drop reorganization. 3) Enhanced Editing: Monaco Editor integration (VS Code editor), language-specific syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error detection, split-view editing. 4) Content Types: Support for code snippets, documentation, images, links, structured data (JSON/YAML), tables/lists. 5) Memory Relationships: Visual connection mapping, automatic link detection, bidirectional references, dependency tracking. Current Status: React dashboard basic functionality working, API endpoints fixed, v2.0.2 ready for NPM publish (requires login). Next: Implement memory cards layout, then advanced editor features.
