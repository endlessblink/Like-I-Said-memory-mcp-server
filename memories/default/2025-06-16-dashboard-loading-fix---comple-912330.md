---DASHBOARD LOADING FIX - COMPLETE SOLUTION: The dashboard was not loading due to mixed old Cytoscape.js code conflicting with new React-Force-Graph implementation. SOLUTION: 1) Complete code rewrite - Rewrote App.tsx from scratch removing 500+ lines of broken code, 2) Fixed syntax errors - Resolved missing brackets and malformed JavaScript, 3) Modern architecture - Implemented React-Force-Graph with WebGL, proper TypeScript, modular helpers, 4) Proper server startup - Use npm run dev:full to start both API (3001) and React (5173) servers, kill existing processes first with pkill -f vite, 5) Verification - npm run build should complete, access http://localhost:5173/. KEY LESSON: Complete rewrite was faster than incremental fixes when mixing old/new code. Final result: Modern dashboard with Cards/Table/Graph views, WebGL visualization, Monaco editor, LLM integration, full CRUD operations.
