---CURRENT SESSION STATE (June 16, 2025): React dashboard API connection fixed, all missing state variables added (newContext, editingContext, editingKey), data structure corrected from object to array format, memory.value changed to memory.content, table rendering fixed, button handlers updated to use memory.id. NPM package bumped to v2.0.2 with all fixes. Dashboard servers running: API on port 3001, React on port 5173. Key remaining: npm login required for publishing, implement visual improvements (memory cards, categories, advanced editor). Commands: 'npm run dev:full' starts both servers, 'curl http://localhost:3001/api/memories' tests API. Advanced features planned: Monaco editor integration, structured memory view with metadata, visual relationship mapping, rich text editing with syntax highlighting.
